## Projects

### Computer Games Data Analysis

I conducted this data analysis project to explore global computer game sales and enhance my Python-based data analysis skills. Using tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I performed trend analyses, visualized sales distributions, and identified key market insights from a real-world dataset. This project not only improved my proficiency in Jupyter Notebooks and data visualization, but also strengthened my ability to interpret data in a business context.
